# Saman9190--Object-Detection-with-RetinaNet
Object detection localizes and classifies objects in images. Models are classified into "single-stage" and "two-stage" detectors, with two-stage being more accurate but slower. We'll implement RetinaNet, a fast and accurate single-stage detector using a feature pyramid network and the Focal loss function to handle class imbalance.
